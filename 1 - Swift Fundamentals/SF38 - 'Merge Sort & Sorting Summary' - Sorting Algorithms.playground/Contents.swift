//  üèîÔ∏è MTECH Code Challenge SF38: "Merge Sort & Sorting Summary"
//  Concept: Review sorting algorithms and demonstrate a base level understanding of time complexity.

//  Instructions:
    //  Do some research on Merge Sort: üîóhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort
    //  Why is this sort more efficient than the other sorts we have learned?
    //  Why would we have you learn about sorting algorithms when there is a perfectly good .sort() function?
    //  Explain your answer in the /* */ comment marks below.

//  ‚å∫ Black Diamond Challenge:
    //  Include extra relevant information you learned in the black diamond challenges in your writing below.
    //  If you have not completed the other black diamond challenges, do those instead.

// MARK: Your response:

/*
 Merge Sorts are more efficient because...
 
 Merge sorts make a bunch of sublists, seperating each and every number, combining them later on after checking their logic, putting them in order.
 
 We need to learn about sorting algorithms so that...
 
 We can figure out what kind of sorting we want to use in our own code and if needed, make our own sorting algorithm
